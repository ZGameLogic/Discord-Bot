This project is written in java. Its purpose is to run my main discord server’s discord bot. It uses the JDA library which is a wrapper for discord’s bot API in java. This project also uses Spring-MVC so I can make a RESTful API to interface with my discord bot via an app on my phone. 
This bot has a ton of functionality, just to cover a few:
Partybot: This allows the user to create a voice chatroom by joining a special create chatroom channel. This keeps the channels neat and clean. It also has special commands to rename the channel, create a text channel that only people in the voice channel can see, and create breakout rooms for people who are playing the same game for a quick switch in those intense gaming moments.
